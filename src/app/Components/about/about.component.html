    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I'm currently attending the University of Pittsburgh.  I spend much of my free time writing stories or creating programming projects.  I created this website to hold some of my stories and projects, and a little bit about me.  Now, I have a place that is mine to post my things; and this is it.</p>
    <p>On top of writing, programming, and drawing, I am also interested in city designing and planning.  I like things to be structured and ordered even if real life doesn't always work out that way.  I'm a perfectionist but a chaotic one.  My stories must all be perfect in my own head, but my path to get there isn't always straightforward.</p>
