    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>The first thing that Darren did when he emerged from his bunker after three months was go to Bell&rsquo;s Bar in Domumport and get drunk. &nbsp;This was because, though his tiny space underground was very well prepared, he only had three bottles of wine with him, which was not enough to keep the oppressive steel walls out of his mind for so long. &nbsp;So around the end of the third month, he had opened the propane valves, climbed out from the hatch, and dropped a lighter down inside.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Bell&rsquo;s Bar was long abandoned by then, as was everything else in Domumport, which used to be a small town of about five hundred people. &nbsp;A thin layer of dust was coated on everything, and there was an eerie silence hanging in the air. &nbsp;The only distant sound was the cool wind rustling the needles of the pine trees, part of the forest that encircled the town and sprawled out for miles. &nbsp;Though the shockwave from the bombs three months ago had not reached this isolated community, the poison in the air must have been enough to drive the townsfolk elsewhere; but Darren couldn&rsquo;t know whether or not they had survived this exodus.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>He was miserable when he walked to Bell&rsquo;s, and he remained just as miserable as a drunken mess on the floor of the bar. &nbsp;With no one left to pay for the alcohol, he threw his wallet aside, and he drank and drank, trying to curb the despair he felt inside. &nbsp;But the only assistance the drink provided was some good sleep, temporarily, as sleeping underground had always been a challenge. &nbsp;After some three days of feeling as useless and alone as he felt in his bunker, he did manage to sober himself up; though he owed this more to the groaning of his stomach than to his own free will. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>The sliding door outside the Foodworld, Domumport&rsquo;s only grocery store, was jammed shut, so Darren wheeled a shopping cart into the brittle glass to shatter a hole. &nbsp;Inside, though many things on the front shelves had rotted or gone bad over the past three months, canned goods took up four entire aisles in the back. &nbsp; Though, nearly half of one of the aisles was just pet food, which he had no intention of eating. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>He opened a can of soup with his pocketknife, and he cooked it over a fire built from newspapers and branches, as well as some money he found in the cash registers. &nbsp;He spent that night in a sleeping bag inside the Foodworld, holding on to a pillow desperately as if it were another person. &nbsp;He had done this every night in the bunker as well; it rarely helped him to fall asleep.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>~</span></p>

    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>It was a shepherd dog of some kind, with black and white fur, and it was far too skinny for its tall stature. &nbsp;Its eyes looked beady and rabid, and they were almost bulging out of its head from how skinny the thing was. &nbsp;Its fur was ruffled and dirty, and it had a red collar on; it had belonged to someone, and now it was free. &nbsp;Darren kept his distance, and put a hand to his pistol&ndash; but the dog slowly began limping away, dragging its left hind leg on the asphalt &ndash; and so Darren lowered his hand.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>The Red Bridge, as it was called, had connected the isolated community of Domumport to the Trans-Canada Highway. &nbsp;Darren had no intent to cross it&mdash;and anyway, as he approached it, he saw that the bridge had collapsed into the river. &nbsp; Instead, he clambered down the rocky side of the hill until he reached the pebbled riverside. &nbsp;The water there seemed fresh enough, and he drank from it. &nbsp;There wasn&rsquo;t much bottled water in the Foodworld.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After climbing back up the rocky hill to Domumport, Darren went to the department store on the corner, and he pulled a tent kit from a high shelf using a golf club. &nbsp; He set it up outside the Foodworld that evening. &nbsp; And when he put up the last leg, it occurred to him that he had truly completed the essentials of food, water, and shelter, and that he would perhaps live a long life in Domumport, especially with the radiation nearly gone from the air. &nbsp;He was almost proud, but deep down he knew that much of his success had simply fallen into his lap &ndash; the tent, the food, the water. &nbsp;Even the underground bunker where he had weathered the war was not of his own creation &ndash; his father had been the paranoid one, and it hadn&rsquo;t even helped him.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That night, he couldn&rsquo;t make himself fall asleep in his constructed tent, no matter how hard he gripped his pillow. &nbsp;On the one hand, he knew he had achieved what he had already in his bunker. &nbsp;But now, already, he was left finished and directionless; there was no challenge left, and no other person for his survival to mean anything to. &nbsp;So shouldn&rsquo;t he just be content to be alive, eating canned food that the dead had prepared for him? &nbsp;Wasn&rsquo;t that the point of life &ndash; to live? &nbsp;But then, what could the purpose of survival be if one doesn&rsquo;t care about a thing besides it?</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Frustrated with the tossing and turning and the pointless thinking, he tore his covers off and unzipped the tent. &nbsp;And outside in the dark, meeting his eyes with a cold gaze, was the tattered face of the shepherd dog. &nbsp;The smell of death emanating from the thing pushed up into Darren&rsquo;s nostrils as their eyes met.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Darren immediately and instinctually felt his pocket for his pistol &ndash; but he had taken it off to sleep. &nbsp; The beast barred its yellow teeth, and Darren kept his eyes locked with it, worried about looking away, about looking weak. &nbsp;He slowly reached behind him for the half filled aluminum can he knew he had left by the entrance to the tent. &nbsp;It was no knife, but it was still weighed down with some chicken soup, and the edges were sharp.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you,&rdquo; Darren whispered pointlessly to the dog.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But as he put his fingers around the can, the beast&rsquo;s eyes darted to it &ndash; and then, as if it were commanded, it sat down before Darren, pushing its tail between its legs. &nbsp; Its eyes went from angled sharply inwards to soft and begging, and it hid its bared teeth.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Darren stared stupefied at the dog. &nbsp;He brought the can slowly forward, peeling off the lid with his other hand.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said softly, setting the soup before the dog. &nbsp;It looked at him for only a moment before immediately sticking its snout in the can, toppling it onto the pavement and spilling the soup everywhere. &nbsp;It started desperately licking it off the ground.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Lovely,&rdquo; Darren said. &nbsp; &ldquo;You could use a bowl, maybe.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dog stopped eating and looked up at him blankly.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>~</span></p>

    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t as tall,&rdquo; he said to the dog as he tore the lid from the can. &nbsp;&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t knock them over.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Darren set the tin on the ground and watched as the dog mutely ate. &nbsp;After a moment, he slowly reached his hand towards the dog&rsquo;s neck, and when it didn&rsquo;t object, he carefully grasped the gold nametag hanging from the collar. &nbsp;The dog kept eating, and Darren turned the thin metal over in his hand.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oliver,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp; The dog stopped eating and looked at him, surprised at hearing syllables that sounded like his name for the first time in so long. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Darren retreated his hand and silently ate a granola bar as Oliver resumed licking the bottom of the tin; but as soon as the food was gone, he licked his lips and trotted off down the street. &nbsp;Darren sat idly and watched him limp away.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>~</span></p>

    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After Oliver left one morning, Darren found a plastic bowl and a tube of tennis balls in the department store. &nbsp;While the dog ate from the bowl, Darren tossed a ball up and down in his hand, but Oliver didn&rsquo;t look up from his meal. &nbsp;He threw the ball down the road, and the dog turned to watch it fly, but then slowly resumed eating when it landed. &nbsp;He was over such games, evidently. &nbsp;Darren threw another one when Oliver&rsquo;s bowl was empty, but the dog just limped off down an alley in the opposite direction.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One day, Oliver didn&rsquo;t leave after breakfast. &nbsp;Instead, he followed Darren down to the river as he bathed in the rushing water. &nbsp; Darren didn&rsquo;t complain or try to shoo him away, but ultimately ignored him as he washed himself. &nbsp;Oliver didn&rsquo;t get in the water -- he spent his time sniffing around by the riverbank. &nbsp;When the two went back up the hill, Oliver beat him to the top and looked down the rocky slabs, waiting for Darren to reach him.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver left again soon after, but returned in the evening. &nbsp;When he finished his tin, rather than walking off, he strode into the tent and laid down on the pillow that Darren had held on to every night. &nbsp; Darren didn&rsquo;t mind, and just slept on the other side of the tent&mdash; though he did close his nostrils with a clothes pin to mask the smell of the dog. &nbsp;But at some point in the night, Oliver waltzed over and laid across Darren&rsquo;s stomach as he slept.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dog gained weight over the next few weeks, and he stopped leaving Darren&rsquo;s side. &nbsp;One day when they went to the river, Oliver waded into the water, and Darren washed his matted fur. &nbsp;When they got out, the smell of death was gone from the dog. &nbsp;Darren ruffled his fur and told him he was a good boy, but the dog seemed annoyed or maybe embarrassed by this, so Darren quickly stopped. &nbsp;He decided that maybe the dog was over being a pet, or being treated as such.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>~</span></p>

    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>~</span></p>

    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>He had gone deep into the pine woods, allowing Oliver to trail behind him. &nbsp;They had intentionally gone opposite the sounds of gunfire from the previous night. &nbsp; After only a mile, Darren saw a rabbit at the base of a tree looking around obliviously. &nbsp;He pointed the shotgun to it.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Oliver seemed undisturbed by the bang, but as soon as he saw the rabbit sprinting away after the missed shot, he pounced forward through the trees. &nbsp;He ran out of sight, and Darren dropped the shotgun and followed; but already as he rounded the base of a tree, the dog was trotting back with a dead rabbit in its mouth. &nbsp; He dropped the carcass at Darren&rsquo;s feet.</span></p>

    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There was swiftness in his packing. &nbsp;He stuffed some cans in his backpack, roughly balancing half his own food and half the dogs, but more in favor of his own. &nbsp;He pocketed his pistol but left the shotgun, not wanting to be weighed down further. &nbsp;He put on his heavy coat, knowing full well that autumn, and then winter, would be coming soon.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They crossed the river beneath the fallen Red Bridge, using the broken support structures in the darkness to guide them across. &nbsp;The water rippled out in thin waves as they waded through, and the edges glistened in the moonlight. &nbsp;Something punctured Darren&rsquo;s hand as he grasped a pillar for guidance. &nbsp;He felt it push in deep and stick, and he cried out in pain but kept moving. &nbsp;When the pair reached the other side, Oliver watched mutely as Darren switched on his flashlight and pulled a blood covered nail from his hand. &nbsp;The sharp point was stained a brighter red than the red of the bridge. &nbsp;When Darren dropped it on the riverside, Oliver approached it, sniffing the blood on the point.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quit,&rdquo; Darren told him. &nbsp; But Oliver kept sniffing, and he licked the blood covered nail.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quit! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s sharp,&rdquo; Darren said, grabbing Oliver&rsquo;s collar and pulling him along. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll cut yourself.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They skimmed up the hill opposite from Domumport. &nbsp;Darren&rsquo;s wet clothes slopped noisily on the rocks as he climbed. &nbsp;Oliver, pawing his own way up the rocks, followed diligently. &nbsp; At the top, they started down the nameless road that linked Domumport to the Trans-Canada Highway. &nbsp;The grey asphalt was overgrown and ruined, and they found themselves jumping over trees and walking around craters.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They reached the highway in the morning, and they stopped by the on ramp to rest. &nbsp; There were dusty vehicles on the roads there &ndash; one had torn through the steel barricade and was flipped over in the grass. &nbsp;Another was smashed into a pine tree. &nbsp;The pair ate in silence, and Darren tended more properly to his wounded hand.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As they began to walk down the highway, Darren could see the needles on the trees were beginning to turn a deeper orange. &nbsp;The whistling wind sent a piece of paper spiraling in their path. &nbsp;Darren watched it slowly settle on a white lane marker in front of them. &nbsp;Those white lines felt enormous now that he walked by them so slowly. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sign for a town called Opasatika, which was built right around the highway. &nbsp;When they walked through, they quickly found it to be as abandoned as Domumport was. &nbsp;It was mostly empty trailers and houses, and the only store in the town center had been cleared out. &nbsp;Darren broke the window of a van and slept in the back while the dog lay outside. &nbsp;That night, for the first time in a long time, Darren couldn&rsquo;t sleep, and he had no pillow to hold.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Three dozen miles later, they hadn&rsquo;t found a speck of food in seven highway towns. &nbsp;There were rivers and there were creeks, of varying quality but still with drinkable water. &nbsp;After checking an old general store in one town, Darren opened his backpack and retrieved a can of dog food, and he scooped out just about half of it. &nbsp; He set the small amount on the pavement for Oliver. &nbsp;The dog only looked up at him with a confused look.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re rationing,&rdquo; Darren told him.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver, though, clearly didn&rsquo;t understand &ndash; likely, he believed he was being punished for something. &nbsp; But still, he ate his half portion. &nbsp; Darren did not eat, knowing that soon he would run out of his own cans. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Eventually, one night after miles and miles of walking, they were out of dog food cans. &nbsp;Darren only ate a granola bar that day, and he watched Oliver sit patiently, waiting for his meal.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said, but Oliver didn&rsquo;t understand.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>They walked another day on the highway and found another empty town. &nbsp;In this one, there were a lot of bullet holes in the buildings, and there were bodies in the streets. &nbsp;Darren, the hunger beginning then to set in within him, considered the unthinkable, but recoiled when the smell of the bodies hit his nose. &nbsp;Oliver, however, approached the bodies with his tail wagging, and Darren could only turn away in horror. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>When Darren opened the door to an abandoned minivan without eating dinner with Oliver, the dog growled and yapped at his feet. &nbsp; Darren told him to back off, and that it wasn&rsquo;t his fault. &nbsp;And then he shut the sliding door and locked it, and he slid out of view to have the last half-can of food by himself, feeling guilty as he ate it. &nbsp;He heard the dog whining miserably outside.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>After five more days of a complete severance from food, Darren tried to shoot the dog. &nbsp;The mutt was already running when he took the shot, so the bullet grazed the top of its fur and made it yelp in pain, but it kept running. &nbsp;Darren had called to the dog, called its name in desperation and regret&mdash;but he knew inside that it would not come back.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>The shooting would have been a mercy, Darren had justified to himself. &nbsp;He knew they were both dead things that had been carrying on for far longer than they had any right or reason to. &nbsp;He had every intent to turn the gun on himself if the meat from the dog&rsquo;s bones didn&rsquo;t sustain him for long enough to find another food source, or to make it back to Domumport. &nbsp;But without the meat from the dog, he figured that he didn&rsquo;t have much of a chance for the latter. &nbsp;Still, he started walking back from where he had come.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>The trees now were burnt orange, and their vein like branches swayed in the cold breeze. &nbsp;Darren walked alone down the highway, shivering in the cold wind. &nbsp;His fur coat was not warm enough to melt the ice he felt deep within his bones.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>There was a rusted bicycle on the side of the road, and though Darren was weak, it was much faster than walking on the flat terrain. &nbsp;He started pedaling back towards Domumport, though he was barely able to keep his balance. &nbsp; He fell off the bike a few times, scraped his arm, cracked his head &ndash; but he got back on, spitting up blood every time. &nbsp;He vomited off the side of the road once, and his throat pulled up only acid because his stomach was so empty. &nbsp;He tried to sleep in abandoned cars, alone, but he rarely could sleep for more than an hour. &nbsp;Vaguely, he thought of his comfort and safety in his old tent with the dog, but his starving mind was too scrambled to hold on to the thought for long.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>In time, he returned to the long and ruined road that led to Domumport. &nbsp;He left his bicycle on the off ramp of the highway, not wanting to attempt to ride it across the holes and fallen trees of the road.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>He reached the collapsed Red Bridge in another day&rsquo;s time, and he waded back across the river. &nbsp;The cold water felt good on his wounds, but the rushing current opened the gash on his arm. &nbsp;He crossed the river slowly, tiredly, and when he reached the other side, he wiped the blood from his arm with his shirt.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>He saw quickly as he reached the top of the hill to Domumport that his old tent was ransacked, in the truest sense of the word. &nbsp; It was torn up, and the metal legs were scattered about, pointing up in different directions like broken masts of a ship. &nbsp;The Foodworld had been cleared out as well &ndash; there wasn&rsquo;t a can left inside. &nbsp;A few brass cartridges and shotgun shells lay littered on the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Darren stayed around Domumport for a while, unable to take further action, feeling the twisting in his stomach and the sinking in his throat grow worse with every hour. &nbsp;He slept through the pain one night in the Foodworld, not expecting to wake up the next morning. &nbsp;When he did, he only had the energy to go lie in the remains of his tent and look upwards at the sky. &nbsp;The clouds were grey and dark, and then he saw something&ndash; the first snowflake of winter beginning to fall down. &nbsp;It got caught in the cold wind and blew out of his upwards gaze. &nbsp;He closed his eyes and began to succumb to the inevitable.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Then the slight patter of footsteps on his right broke his trance, and he turned to see a dog walking towards him.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&ldquo;Oliver,&rdquo; Darren managed.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>And indeed the dog was Oliver &ndash; but as Darren saw, his fur was mangled and bloody. &nbsp;He had killed something and rolled in it. &nbsp;And likely in this process, his collar had broken off, along with the gold tag that bore his name.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Darren closed his eyes, and the dog stopped above him&mdash;it once again smelled of death, but Darren didn&rsquo;t cover his nose. &nbsp; Instead, he brought his shaking hand towards Oliver&rsquo;s neck, where his collar had once been. &nbsp;Oliver only stared as the fingers approached him.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&ldquo;Have you brought me anything to eat?&rdquo; Darren asked softly as he held his hand before the dog. &nbsp;And Oliver, skinny again, with his eyes bulging, reached his snout forward and bit the hand that had fed him, tasting its warm blood for the second and final time.</span></p>
