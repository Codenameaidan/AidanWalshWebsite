<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:normal;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><em><span style="font-size:16px;">By Aidan J. Walsh</span></em></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">My friend Andy used to drive me to and from work because I always got lost on the back roads going home. &nbsp; One time, driving on a normal, starless night, we hit this guy named Rupert, and we buried him by a gnarled tree a few hundred feet into the woods. &nbsp;Andy said we needed to, and I guess he was right. &nbsp;Well, maybe I didn&rsquo;t so much agree as I did mutely follow his instruction. &nbsp;He was the smart one, with an engineer&rsquo;s mind. &nbsp;I helped him dig and I dragged the body off the road because he didn&rsquo;t want to touch it.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">No one else knew about it. &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t see anything in the papers, and I checked every day for five months. &nbsp;Eventually, I stopped checking. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think anyone was really looking for Rupert. &nbsp;His clothes were torn up like he was homeless or a lonesome drifter, but maybe that was just from the impact of the car and then the wheels. &nbsp; The way he became bumps in the asphalt to us. &nbsp;This was around South Pine, Georgia, where Andy and I both lived at the time.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">Anyway, I saw Andy at work the day after it happened. &nbsp;He was flipping burgers with his bright yellow suit on, and he looked like he hadn&rsquo;t slept. &nbsp;He had the morning shift. &nbsp;I tried to lift his spirits.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going out to see a movie,&rdquo; I said to him through the steam that the hot grill emanated. &nbsp;&ldquo;Me and Cynthia. &nbsp;You know Cynthia? &nbsp;Tonight. &nbsp; If you wanted to come with us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;A movie?&rdquo; he said distantly. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re thinking about?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">I became conscious then of some social error &ndash; was this not what friends did to cheer one another up? &nbsp; So I just didn&rsquo;t respond.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;Anyway, I don&rsquo;t want to be a third wheel,&rdquo; he clarified. &nbsp;His eyes didn&rsquo;t meet mine when he replied, and they looked like they were retreating deeper into his skull. &nbsp;His dark circles were stacking, a new layer being added hour after hour. &nbsp;I guess the whole situation had gotten to him.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">But that was that. &nbsp;Andy left work that afternoon early, told our boss that he had the stomach flu. &nbsp;Maybe he did. &nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t come back. &nbsp;He got a job at a Petco across town.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">I picked Cynthia up that night, and we skipped the movie. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t tell her about the accident in the woods. &nbsp;I just drove around, and she talked at me about her friend Emily and some drama about who-knows-what. &nbsp;I guess it was important to her. &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t really paying attention. &nbsp;I was watching the twin yellow lines of the road pass by on my left. &nbsp; &nbsp;When we went back to my flat, she sort of quizzed me on the drama, asking what I would do in Emily&rsquo;s position.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said. &nbsp; &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d do the right thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so good,&rdquo; she told me, and that made me feel a little better.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We got married a few years later. &nbsp;Me and Cynthia. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know why. &nbsp;She proposed, and I guess I just go along with things. &nbsp;I loved her as much as I loved anyone else. &nbsp;Andy was at the wedding, but he didn&rsquo;t look quite right. &nbsp; Like he still hadn&rsquo;t slept a single night. &nbsp;After that, though, I didn&rsquo;t see him again for a long time.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia and I moved into a nice suburb on the outskirts of Macon. &nbsp;She had finished her degree and had found a good enough job in the city. &nbsp;I found a job at a local Sheetz which paid less but wasn&rsquo;t too bad. &nbsp;Our house was a few hours from South Pine. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">We had neighbors who were nice. &nbsp;In the suburbs. &nbsp;I met some of them at what they called a &lsquo;block party&rsquo; where the neighborhood comes together to eat and celebrate its existence. &nbsp;We were in the backyard of somebody&rsquo;s house that looked exactly like ours. &nbsp;Some kids played on a backyard jungle-gym, and I sat talking to Cynthia for a while. &nbsp;She left to talk to some other people, but I stayed sitting with the high sun on my neck. &nbsp; The grass was bright, and I sat oddly, out of place, beer in hand. &nbsp;But it wasn&rsquo;t so bad. &nbsp;I liked the nature, even in such an artificial place. &nbsp;I turned to Cynthia and saw her laughing with a group of people and pointing towards me. &nbsp;What a perfect middle class life. &nbsp;I was happy enough.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">She lied about being on the pill and poked holes in a few condoms, and so we had our first in March. &nbsp;I knew about all that, but I didn&rsquo;t say anything. &nbsp; She chose the name Evan. &nbsp;I looked into Evan&rsquo;s eyes and there was something behind there. &nbsp;Some sort of glow. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t explain it. &nbsp;Cynthia was just excited that he was an Aries like she was. &nbsp;I guess she had it planned out, though.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">My job at the Sheetz was banal. &nbsp;People dropped like flies and I usurped their responsibilities. &nbsp;Mr. Ericson, my manager, liked to schedule me where five people should have been working. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t bump my pay or anything. &nbsp;Mr. Ericson said I was a &ldquo;hard worker,&rdquo; and I worked long shifts because I didn&rsquo;t object. &nbsp; I went along with it. &nbsp;The only good guy there was this kid Billie, who was a hard worker too, and we talked sometimes. &nbsp;Besides him and Cynthia, I didn&rsquo;t talk to anyone.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;You ought to get a better job,&rdquo; Cynthia told me one day when I got back from a twelve-hour shift. &nbsp; Evan was two years old then.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;I ought to,&rdquo; I said, but I didn&rsquo;t do anything about it.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">But really, home life wasn&rsquo;t much better than work at that point. &nbsp;Cynthia had gotten into the habit of lying about a lot of little things. &nbsp;Maybe she always did that. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;She always told me she did the dishes &lsquo;last night&rsquo; and so I ended up doing them every night. &nbsp;But I didn&rsquo;t complain to her or argue. &nbsp;I never did. &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t even mind doing the dishes, I just wished she didn&rsquo;t lie about it.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">Billie, the guy at my work, was a smart kid. &nbsp;He was going to school for engineering or something. &nbsp;Always going on about roundabouts and how efficient they were. &nbsp;I said I didn&rsquo;t like roundabouts. &nbsp;He was nineteen when he had a heart attack in front of me. &nbsp; Some lady screamed and told me to do C.P.R. &nbsp;So I did my best. &nbsp;But he didn&rsquo;t make it. &nbsp;When the paramedics took over, I stepped back and watched as they sliced his shirt open and put stickers on his chest. &nbsp;They zapped him for a while and then they shook their heads. &nbsp;When I told Cynthia about it, she said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; I said.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">That night I went back to South Pine. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t go to Rupert then, just drove around the town. &nbsp;I think I was looking for Andy, or maybe my parent&rsquo;s old house. &nbsp;I was drifting. &nbsp;Lost. &nbsp;Thinking about dead people. &nbsp;But there was nothing for me there, in South Pine. &nbsp;When I got home early in the morning, Cynthia said she was worried about me. &nbsp; She hugged me, hid her face in my chest, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever leave me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;How can you let stuff like that get to you? &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t know him, right?&rdquo; she said.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;Billie?&rdquo; I said, and I thought about Rupert.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">She wanted another kid around that time, and I said, well, okay. &nbsp;We might have even conceived her that night. &nbsp;A life springing up from the ashes of another. &nbsp;Cynthia picked the name Evalyn, and she was an Aries too. &nbsp;I looked into her eyes and tried to see if she had any emotions behind them or if she was like her parents. &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t sure.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">Then there was this high schooler who worked with me who liked to steal from the registers. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know how she got away with it, I really don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;One day she stole out of my register. &nbsp;I watched it happen, but I just counted my money that night as if I didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;The next morning, Mr. Ericson was peeved that my drawer balance was a hundred off.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;I took it,&rdquo; I told him.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;You <em>stole</em> it?&rdquo; he said incredulously, like I had let him down, and I got my lunch from the freezer and drove home. &nbsp;I called Cynthia and told her that I had been fired.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;Fuck them,&rdquo; Cynthia said. &nbsp; &ldquo;Accusing you with no proof?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;I confessed to it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;Even still.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">I guess she was right.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">After that, she didn&rsquo;t want to keep paying for daycare for the kids, so I was a stay-at-home dad. &nbsp;I mostly didn&rsquo;t see Evan and Evalyn in any real sense, though. &nbsp;They were just these objects, shadows, running amuck around the house. &nbsp;Mostly I just watched Netflix, and sometimes Evan would come on the couch with me, and we&rsquo;d watch some documentary about war together while Evalyn played with her toys.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">One time when Evan was seven, he took apart the thermostat in the living room. &nbsp;Cynthia was angry about it, but I just thought it was a sign of an engineer&rsquo;s mind. &nbsp;She asked me to sit down and talk with him since taking stuff apart was &ldquo;guy stuff&rdquo; in her words. &nbsp;So I did.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do stuff like that,&rdquo; I said to Evan.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">I raised an eyebrow. &nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take apart what isn&rsquo;t yours,&rdquo; I said.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long drive to South Pine,&rdquo; I halfheartedly said.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&ldquo;We did a terrible thing,&rdquo; Andy said finally.</span></p>
